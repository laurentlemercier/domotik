# data analysis

This page is a collection of reflection about data analysis. It is an introduction
of a new feature of this sofware.

Currently, services detection are based on an analysis of the received data between
yesterday an now. If this value is greater than x percent, there is a problem.

My two years of data collection are a funny sandbox which i'm going to use to
experiment some features like :

- detect abnormal power consumption
- detect abnormal human intrusion
- detect the best moment to turn on my heaters
- detect a heat wave
- etc.

first of all, how to extract data from mongodb?
```
$> mongoexport --host localhost --db domotik --collection measures --csv --out export.csv --fields type,sensor,value,timestamp
```

the second step is focused on transforming data to generate several files
```
$> python transform.py tankHotWaterPerDay > tankHotWaterPerDay.csv
```

using panda via docker is a good way to save your time!
```
$> go to https://github.com/ContinuumIO/docker-images/tree/master/anaconda
$> docker pull continuumio/anaconda
$> docker run -i -t -p 8888:8888 continuumio/anaconda /bin/bash -c "/opt/conda/bin/conda install jupyter -y --quiet && mkdir /opt/notebooks && /opt/conda/bin/jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=/opt/notebooks --ip='*' --port=8888 --no-browser"
$> go to http://localhost:8888
```

enter something like that
```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('sumPerDay.csv')
min = df.groupby(['month','day']).mean() - df.groupby(['month','day']).std()
max = df.groupby(['month','day']).mean() + df.groupby(['month','day']).std()
print min.value
print max.value
min.to_csv('sumPerDay.min')
max.to_csv('sumPerDay.max')
```

retrieve this files from jupyter and store it into the folder 'services/data'

at this point, we could use min and max to check if a new value is "correct"
